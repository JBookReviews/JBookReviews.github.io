		<p>Hi, my name is Jack and I LOVE books. All kinds of books, fantasy, mystery, even non-fiction! I know a lot of people who don't like books. I think that it's because they gaven't found that one special book that changes thier mind. Thats what I'm for, I review tons of books for you to try and enjoy. And if you discover your love of reading, then I'm super happy for you. What are you waiting for? Get started!</p>
